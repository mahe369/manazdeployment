# Nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value
We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

Input object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
Input key = a/b/c
Output value = d
Input object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
Input key = x/y
Output value = {“z”:”a”}
